# OSINT_VM_Setup
Repo for setup scrips. From https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook/

## Summary:
Every OSINT investigation should use a clean VM. Thankfully, Michael Bazzell and David Westcott have outlined an excellent method for setting up a VM as well as many helpful tools. This repository serves as a one stop shop for quickly getting all the setup scripts. I have made a few edits and comments to customize the VM to my liking. Eventually, I would like to automate the setup into one single script that can be run once.

## List of Differences between my VM and Bazzells:

- Using "Oh my Zsh" and custom theme

- Background is changed

- I use VMware

- Customized browsers to have links to cool OSINT resources.

- I may put the "high traffic" resources like sublis3r or spiderfoot on my Digital Ocean droplet.
